Name
Maze Explorer


Overview
The goal of this project is to make a platform game that implements Prim’s algorithm to generate infinite layers. The player is required to control its character with ‘left’, ‘right’ and space keys in order to successfully escape the maze. Moreover, the player needs to avoid/ stay away from an semi-intelligent enemy which chases after him. If the player collides with the enemy, the game ends. Similarly, if the player touches the red boxes--lava, the game ends as well. 


Competitive Analysis
Platform/maze game such as: Donkey kong, Super meat boy 
A maze like platform game, somewhat different from the traditional ones. Instead of jumping between platforms, I will design a one that runs in a maze and a enemy chasing after the player. 


Structural Plan 
* functions in tracking the character’s position, moving the player, enemy around, barriers(lava),  and keys
* A semi-intelligent enemy 
* core algorithm of how to generate a random maze






Timeline Plan 
By TP2, I’ll make a playable platform game: 
* Controllable player 
* Semi-intelligent enemy 
* Obstacles: Lava 
* Keys: blue boxes






TP1 Update 
* Basic gameplay: 
   * Wall collision detection to stay within the maze
   * Red “lava squares” 
   * Level can be completed and move on to the next one
   * Currently 2 hardcoded levels 


TP2 Update 
* Added Level 3
* Added basic enemy (move horizontally at the bottom of the maze)


TP3 Update 
* Created player class and enemy class
* Implemented maze algorithm to generate random mazes 
* Fixed the bounciness of the player 
* Add level count
* Implement the ending box: grey from the beginning of the game, green when all the blue boxes/food are eaten   
* Redesigned the starting page 
* Changed the number of keys of the auto-generated levels 


What to do:
* Add a starting page 
* Add level count 
* Change the font and color
* Speed of ball can increase? 
* Maybe replace the player and enemy?
